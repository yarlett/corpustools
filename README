corpustools is a Go library which provides some statistical natural language processing functionality. It is intended to be fairly lightweight, to operate with anything up to medium-sized corpora (hundreds of millions of words), and to be relatively quick. With this in mind many of its operations are based on a suffix array index into corpora.

Installation instructions
=========================

1. Install Go on your system.
2. Download this repository into your $GOPATH.
3. Type "go install corpustools".

Functionality
=============

Much of the core functionality of the library is available through the Corpus object.

To create a corpus object from a text file:

	import "corpustools"
	corpus := corpustools.CorpusFromFile("myfile.txt", true)

which will tokenize myfile.txt into lower-case words, and create a Corpus object from the resulting sequence of words. Each distinct word is assigned a unique integer key so that the corpus can be stored internally as a sequence of integers. When the corpus object is created a suffix array which indexes into the corpus array is automatically created so that statistics can be computed on the corpus in O(log(n)) instead of O(n).

For example, to compute the frequency of a specified sequence:

	f := corpus.Frequency(int[]{1, 2, 3})

To generate the set of all trigrams in the corpus:

	trigrams := corpus.Ngrams(3)
